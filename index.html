    <h2>Hello.</h2>
    <p class="bio">Before becoming enamored in the field of engineering,
        my interest led me into Medical Technology. A field where I applied
        myself deep into the studies of the cellular world and how it all works to keep us going every day.
        I am not afraid to take risks and as a result along with passion and ambition for learning
        I ventured into the wide world of Technology where I decided to make the switch over
        to the Service Engineer field with Sysmex. Outside of my work, I am currently partaking in a coding bootcamp
        called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/">"100 Days of Code"</a>  taught by Dr. Angela Yu.</p>

      <h3 class="skill1">Software Development</h3>
      <p class="skill-bio">For many years, I have had the strong desire to want to begin coding. Whether it was tinkering with C# with my friends
          in high school between gaming sessions, or my urge to self-teach python, it was always there. Over the past
          couple of months, I've finally dived into the work of Programming and Software Development through
          a Python Bootcamp. During this bootcamp, I had the opportunity to learn HTML & CSS which I used to develop
          this site! Check out my  <strong><a href="https://github.com/TheKevCo">github</a></strong> for more of my
          projects!</p>

      <h3 class="skill2">Service Engineering</h3>
      <p class="service-bio">You ever wondered what happens to that pink lavender top tube after you get your blood drawn from the
          doctors office? 90%+ chance that tube of blood is probably ran through one of the medical devices I
          work on in a daily basis in my company. Sysmex provides cutting edge technology made for the patient
          and designed with quality in mind. Just like any device, upkeep is important. That is my role in the
          company as a Service Engineer, fixing, maintaining and implementing new software updates as needed.</p>
